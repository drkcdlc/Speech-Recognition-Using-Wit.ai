# Speech-Recognition-Using-Wit.ai

The program uses wit.ai's API to obtain what the user is saying on the voice clip. The voice clip can be max. 10 seconds. If you want to change it, you can change it on: 
phrase_time_limit = 10

Also, you need to give your wit.ai API key to the program on:
key="apikeyofwitai"
